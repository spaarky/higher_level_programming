# Python - Hello, World

In this project, I learned how to print text and variables, indexing and slicing strings in Python.

## Tasks
* **0. Hello, print**
    * [2-print.py](./2-print.py): Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line using the function `print`.

* **1. Print integer**
    * [3-print_number.py](./3-print_number.py): Python script that prints the integer stored
     in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py).

* **2. Print float**
    * [4-print_float.py](./4-print_float.py): Python script that prints the float stored
    in the variable `number` with a precision of two digits.
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py).

* **3. Print string**
    * [5-print_string.py](./5-print_string.py): Python script that prints a string stored
    in the variable `str` three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters
    contained in `str`, followed by another new line.
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py).

* **4. Play with strings**
    * [6-concat.py](./6-concat.py): Python script that prints `Welcome to Holberton
    School!` using the variables `str1 = "Holberton"` and `str2 = "School"`.
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py).

* **5. Copy - Cut - Paste**
    * [7-edges.py](./7-edges.py): Python script that sets three string variables based
    on the string contained in the variable `word` as follows:
    * `word_first_3`: Contains the first three letters of the variable `word`.
    * `word_last_2`: Contains the last two letters of the variable `word`.
    * `middle_word`: Contains the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters.
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py).

* **6. Create a new sentence**
    * [8-concat_edges.py](./8-concat_edges.py): Python script that prints `object-oriented
    programming with Python`, followed by a new line without creating new variables or
    string literals.
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/8-concat_edges.py).

* **7. Easter Egg**
    * [9-easter_egg.py](./9-easter_egg.py): Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by
    Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
